Smile School: Learn to Light Up the World with Your Smile!

This project is a visually appealing and informative landing page for a website dedicated to teaching the art of smiling. It provides clear calls to action, showcases the instructors, highlights popular tutorials, and addresses frequently asked questions.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional for enhanced interactivity).

**Local Setup:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. (For a more realistic experience, you can use a local development server.)

**Customization**

- Images: Replace the placeholder images (fakeimg.pl) and instructor images (images/1 (3).png, etc.) with your own.
- Content: Edit the text content in the HTML sections (e.g., `<h3>Get schooled</h3>`, `<p>Lorem ipsum...</p>`) to reflect your smiling instruction curriculum.
- Social Media Links: Update the social media icons in the footer (fa-facebook, fa-twitter, fa-instagram) with your preferred platforms' links.

**Deployment**

For online accessibility, upload the project files to a web hosting service.
Consider using a Content Management System (CMS) for easier content updates in the future.

**Additional Notes**

Feel free to explore adding more features or layouts using CSS and JavaScript to further enhance the user experience.
Consider responsiveness (adapting to different screen sizes) for optimal viewing across devices.

Let's get everyone smiling!
